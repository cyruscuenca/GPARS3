This parser is for a LEGO 3D printer I'm making. 
The program is for LEGO 3D printers that use the Cartesian Coordinate System
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system

This program is being worked on by Xander Soldaat: http://botbench.com
and myself: http://cyruscuenca.blogspot.com

I don't have a working program yet. Feel free to look at my code and give me pointers! I'm a noob.
