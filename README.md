# g-pars3

A LEGO MINDSTORMS g-code parser written with ROBOTC.

This is a custum g-code parser written with ROBOTC
(a suite of functions to program LEGO robots).

Check out: http://robotc.net

This parser is for a LEGO 3D printer I'm making. I don't have a working program yet. 
Feel free to look at my code and give me pointers!I'm a noob.

This program is being worked on by Xander Soldaat: http://botbench.com

and myself: http://cyruscuenca.blogspot.com
