# g-pars3

An LMS g-code parser written with ROBOTC.

This is a custum g-code parser written with ROBOTC(a suite of functions to program LEGO robots).
Check out: http://robotc.net

This parser is for a LEGO 3D printer I'm making. I don't have a working program yet. Feel free to look at m code and give me pointers!
(I'm a noob)

This program is being worked on by myself: http://cyruscuenca.blogspot.com
and Xander Soldaat: http://botbench.com
